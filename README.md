## About
This site visualizes the usual range of deadlines for top-rated computer science conferences. The conference rankings are based on the CORE2023 ranking. The deadline data is from WikiCFP. The data is from 2018-2023.

## How to use
Click on the tabs to view the deadlines for different conference rankings. The deadlines are color-coded based on the type of deadline. The black bars represent the overall duration of the conference. The grey bars represent the average deadline with a 2 standard deviation range. The colored bars represent the actual deadline range (the minimum and maximum dates in the dataset).
